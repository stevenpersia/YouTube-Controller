Here's how to play a YouTube video without being spoiled, especially during the duration of the video. Indeed, it often happens when you watch a VOD of an esport event, quickly guess the final score of the match.

It's an improvement of a tutorial realized by [TutorialZine (Danny Markov)](https://tutorialzine.com/2015/08/how-to-control-youtubes-video-player-with-javascript) to adapt it to my needs. I made a small interface and added a feature of forward and rewind for my other [repository](https://github.com/stevenpersia/Esport-VODs). I hope he does not blame me! :)

Icons comes from [icon8](https://icons8.com/).
